###### This program will help users calculate the total price as well as the individual price of their meal. The program will also show the best method/algorithm of payment depending on how many people there are, how much money each person has, and the total price of the meal. It also has an in-built menu, in which the prices and names of meals can be easily edited before performing the calculation. Please run the RestaurantMain.py python file to see the result.
